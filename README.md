## REQUIREMENTS

The climax of this course is our final project. The final project is our opportunity to take our newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop our very own piece of software. So long as our project draws upon this course's lessons, the nature of our project is entirely up to us.

## COVID-19 Stats

For the final project, I chose to build a corona dashboard. I wanted to learn about how to deal with json data and how to visualize data in graphs.

With this website, I wanted to challenge myself and see how easy/hard it is to build a dashboard that representates data like John Hopkins' corona dashboard.

### Features
- Accordion
- Column Graphs
- Country filter
- Geographical Datamap
- Sortable Table

## FILES

### app.js
This js files contains all the Javascript used on the website. Some of features done with javascript:
- Table
- Column Graphs
- Country filter
- Geographical Datamap
- Number formatting
- Loading data from github

### styles.css
All the css for the entire website.

### templates
- index.html
- info.html
- layout.html

## PROJECT LEARNINGS
This project has been a lot of fun. It's far from perfect, but I have learned a lot about data visualization and how to deal with JSON data.

My main goal for this final project was to get a better understanding of data visualization. The first time I looked on https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html made me want to try and make such a dashboard myself. Especially how to visualize the data with a Geographical Map.

Thanks to this final project, I have learned the following:

### Javascript
- Use of fetch and how to process/use the data.
- How to use Google Chart to make:
  - Column Graphs
  - Geographical Datamap
  - Table
- Number formatting with regex
